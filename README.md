# Votes-Server

Votes-Server handles the incoming votes and suggestions for the Everybody Votes Channel.

To run this you need [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) and an Everybody Votes Channel WAD with the server pointed to the address of the machine that is running this server.

Setup the database using the schema.sql then insert your credentials into config.xml and you are set!
